When you look at what Google has just achieved, it‚Äôs no wonder OpenAI suddenly released Sora a few hours later to distract the world from the fact they aren‚Äôt in the lead anymore in the Large Language Model (LLM) space.

Google‚Äôs Gemini 1.5 Pro is a generational leap in terms of Multimodal Large Language Models, or MLLMs, much like GPT-4 was to LLMs back in March 2023.

Specifically, it‚Äòs capable of processing millions of words at a time, 40-minute-long videos, or 11 hours of audio in seconds with 99% context retrieval accuracy, absolutely unheard of in the field until today.

The long-sequence era has arrived, and with it, a new dominant player looks down at OpenAI for the first time.

This insight and others have mostly been previously shared in my weekly newsletter, TheTechOasis.

If you want to be up-to-date with the frenetic world of AI while also feeling inspired to take action or, at the very least, to be well-prepared for the future ahead of us, this is for you.
